# Project-HR-analysis
This code presents a hybrid method for contactless heart rate estimation from video sequences. Facial signals are extracted and optimized using the Firefly Algorithm to improve feature quality. The optimized features are processed by a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for accurate and robust heart rate prediction.
